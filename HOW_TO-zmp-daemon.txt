    - You must generate trajectories from a remote computer
      that has 64-bit architecture, and send the trajectories
      over ach using achd push (explained below).

    - This is due 1) to Hubo's computer not being fast enough
      and 2) to non-exact types being passed over ach.
      This will be fixed in the future.

###### SETUP ########
#####################

1) WALKER (On HUBO, i.e. hubo-linux computer)

    0. Connect to the motion computer on Hubo
        $ ssh username@hubo-linux  (if you don't have a username, use "hubo")

    1. Clone the examples-hubo-motion-rt repo and checkout branch "pete/zmpwalker"
        $ git clone https://github.com/pvieira3/examples-hubo-motion-rt.git
        $ cd examples-hubo-motion-rt
        $ git checkout pete/zmpwalker

    2. Setup and compile walker
        $ ./setup

    2b. After doing setup, you can just use "$ make walker" to compile new code

    3. Start up Hubo
        $ sudo service hubo-motion start

    4. In the console program that pops up, run "startup" to initialize the sensors
       and "homeAll" to home the joints. A list of joints that failed to home with
       show up. To home failed joints, run "reset JNT", where JNT is the 3-letter
       name of the joint, and "home JNT".
        >> startup
        >> homeAll

    5. Start the walker program after setting up the zmp-daemon on the remote computer,
       but before starting the zmp-daemon program.
        $ ./walker

    6. Hubo is now waiting for trajectories from the hubo-zmp-traj channel

2) ZMP-DAEMON (On remote 64-bit PC)

    1. Clone hubomz repo and checkout branch "pete
        $ git clone https://github.com/golems/hubomz.git
        $ cd hubomz
        $ git checkout pete

    2. Install dependencies

    3. Setup and compile zmp-daemon (in top directory "hubomz")
        $ ./setup

    4. Create the ach channel, start achd push (in top directory "hubomz")
        $ sudo ./run start

    5. In a NEW TERMINAL navigate to hubomz directory and start the zmp-daemon program
        $ ./build/zmp-daemon myhubo.kinbody.xml

Keyboard Controls

    NOTE:
        Keys are pressed once to execute each command.
        No key should be pressed and held

    CURRENTLY WORKING KEYS COMMANDS:
        i: walk forward
        k: stop

    TO BE IMPLEMENTED SOON:
        m: walk backward
        j: sidestep left
        l: sidestep right
        u: turn left more
        o: turn right more
        h: turn in place left
        ;: turn in place right
